# PictureSensation - a mobile application to help the blind explore the visual world through touch and sound

 ## About
PictureSensation, a mobile application for the hapto-acoustic exploration of images. It is designed to allow for the visually impaired to gain direct perceptual access to images via an acoustic signal. PictureSensation introduces a swipe-gesture based, speech-guided, barrier free user interface to guarantee autonomous usage by a blind user. It implements a recently proposed exploration and audification principle, which harnesses exploration methods that the visually impaired are used to from everyday life. In brief, a user explores an image actively on a touch screen and receives auditory feedback about its content at his current finger position. PictureSensation provides an extensive tutorial and training mode, to allow for a blind user to become familiar with the use of the application itself as well as the principles of image content to sound transformations, without any assistance from a normal-sighted person. We show our applicationâ€™s potential to help visually impaired individuals explore, interpret and understand entire scenes, even on small smartphone screens. Providing more than just verbal scene descriptions, PictureSensation presents a valuable mobile tool to grant the blind access to the visual world through exploration, anywhere.
